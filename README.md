# Flappy-Bird-Get-Rekt

This is a test which I will apply the things learnt from my 2D-Self-Driving-Car-Python-3 project to flappy bird. 
This will be my own version of using reinforcement learning to defeat flappy bird without computer vision. I will
just be feeding in data like height of slit, distance to slit, height of bird. The point of doing this is mainly to
see just how fast the PyTorch library is can solve the issue. Because flappy bird is acutally considered a "trivial" 
problem that hard coding/explicit coding would have worked without AI. But no, that is not the point haha.
